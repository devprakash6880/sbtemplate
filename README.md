# sbtemplate
It's a simple spirng boot template. It has a default UI template, tiles-view configuration and user authentication. 

Anyone can download it and run as spring boot application through eclipse or you can run from command line using this command 'mvn spring-boot:run'.

Prior to this you need to configure database related things. I developed this using MySQL DB. If you want to use the same you can simply edit DB configuration, by editing application.properties file. Else you neeed to add required dependency in POM.xml and also need to edit application.properties as per need. 

As per this project, you need to hit localhost:8999 in your browser. If you want to change the port number, you can change in application.properties file.
